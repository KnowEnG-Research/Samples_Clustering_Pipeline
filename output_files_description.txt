All four makefile targets in the Samples Clustering Pipeline create a tab separated key value file with the .tsv extension.
The first column (key) is the list of column names (sample names, or gene-set names) from the spreadsheet.
The second column is the cluster label assignment for each sample name.

The two makefile targets with _cc_ in the target name also save the consensus matrix as a (pandas dataframe) spreadsheet.
The row labels are the column names (sample names, or gene-set names) from the spreadsheet.
The consensus matrix data is symmetric and column labels are the (not unique) cluster assignments.
The consensus matrix data is normaize between 0 and 1 and may be usefull as an indicator of cluster assignment confidence.
