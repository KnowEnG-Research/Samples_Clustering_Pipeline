yaml parameters files for make targets are key value pairs separated by full colon and a space.


    run_nmf:
run_file is cluster_nmf_run_file.yml and these keys are common to all four .yml files
# directory names are self expalnitory
samples_file_name: ./run_dir/input_data/final_clean_full_matrix.df
results_directory: ./run_dir/results
tmp_directory: ./run_dir/tmp
# method must be cluster_nmf for make run_nmf
method: cluster_nmf
# matrix factorization inner dimension k is also the maximum number of clusters that could appear.
k: "4"
# objective function check frequency. Slows computation if checked on every iteration ("1")
obj_fcn_chk_freq: "50"
# iterations maximum for the matrix factoriztion if the objective function fails to converge
it_max: "10000"
# "h" matrix clustering equal to previous clustering is the objective function
h_clust_eq_limit: "200"
# display clusters as a graphic if running on machine with graphical
display_clusters: "0"
# command line ouput progress like: >>nmf 1 of 800
verbose: "0"
# the output files will not be time-stamped if use_now_name is "0"
use_now_name: "1"


    run_cc_nmf:
run_file is cc_cluster_nmf_run_file.yml and needs two additional key: value pairs:
method: cc_cluster_nmf
# bootstrap sampling takes this percent of samples and of genes.
percent_sample: "0.8"
# number of matrix factorizations of percent sampled samples incorporated into the consensus matrix.
number_of_bootstraps: "3"


    run_net_nmf:
run_file is net_cluster_nmf_run_file.yml these key: value pairs (in addition to run_nmf target pairs).
method:  net_cluster_nmf
# network file expected format: [node_name, node_name, edge_weight, edge_type]
network_file_name: ./run_dir/input_data/final_clean_4col.edge
# maximum number of iterations in random walk with restart algorithm
number_of_iteriations_in_rwr: "100"   
# random walk with restart algorithm converges when the norm changes less than restart_tolerance
restart_tolerance: "0.0001"
# lambda parameter in matrix factorization function governs how much to use the network
lmbda: "1400"    
# random walk with restart probability setting goverens convergence time and clustering accuracy
restart_probability: "0.7"   


    run_cc_net_nmf:
run_file cc_net_cluster_nmf_run_file.yml needs these two in addition to run_net_nmf pairs.
method: cc_cluster_nmf
# bootstrap sampling takes this percent of samples and of genes.
percent_sample: "0.8"
# number of matrix factorizations of percent sampled samples incorporated into the consensus matrix.
number_of_bootstraps: "3"
